//The derivation of the word Polymorphism is from two different Greek words- poly and morphs.
//“Poly” means numerous, and “Morphs” means forms. So polymorphism means innumerable forms.
//Polymorphism is one of the most significant features of Object-Oriented Programming.
//Example:
class Shapes {
  public void area() {
    System.out.println("The formula for area of ");
  }
}
class Triangle extends Shapes {
  public void area() {
    System.out.println("Triangle is ½ * base * height ");
  }
}
class Circle extends Shapes {
  public void area() {
    System.out.println("Circle is 3.14 * radius * radius ");
  }
}
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Shapes myShape = new Shapes();  // Create a Shapes object
    Shapes myTriangle = new Triangle();  // Create a Triangle object
    Shapes myCircle = new Circle();  // Create a Circle object
    myShape.area();
    myTriangle.area();
    myShape.area();
    myCircle.area();
  }
}
The formula for the area of Triangle is ½ * base * height
The formula for the area of the Circle is 3.14 * radius * radius
