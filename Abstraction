Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that “shows” only essential attributes and “hides” unnecessary information.
The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users.
Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the object to the user. It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts. 
It is one of the most important concepts of OOPs.

In this example, Bike is an abstract class that contains only one abstract method run.
Its implementation is provided by the Honda class.
Example:
abstract class Bike{  
  abstract void run();  
}  
class Honda4 extends Bike{  
void run(){System.out.println("running safely");}  
public static void main(String args[]){  
 Bike obj = new Honda4();  
 obj.run();  
}  
}
