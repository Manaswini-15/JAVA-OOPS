//Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism to wrap up variables(data) and methods(code) together as a single unit. 
//It is the process of hiding information details and protecting data and behavior of the object. 
//It is one of the four important OOP concepts. The encapsulate class is easy to test, so it is also better for unit testing.
Example:
class Account {
    private int account_number;
    private int account_balance;

    public void show Data() {
        //code to show data 
    }

    public void deposit(int a) {
        if (a < 0) {
            //show error 
        } else
            account_balance = account_balance + a;
    }
}
